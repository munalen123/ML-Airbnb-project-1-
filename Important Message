This notebook was originally completed and fully functional. However, when reopening the project the next day, I encountered kernel-related issues that caused the notebook to break or certain cells to stop running. This was likely due to a stale or disconnected kernel session still running in the background, which disrupted variable initialization and model execution. While the code structure and logic are intact, re-running the notebook in a fresh Jupyter environment may be required. Screenshots included in the README serve as proof that the full model training, predictions, and interactive map components were successfully executed and working during the original session.
