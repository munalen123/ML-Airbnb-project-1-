## ⚠️ Important Message

This notebook was originally completed and fully functional. However, when reopening the project the next day, I encountered kernel-related issues that caused the notebook to break or certain cells to stop running. This was likely due to a stale or disconnected kernel session.

A fresh Jupyter environment may be needed to rerun the notebook top to bottom.

✅ *Screenshots included in the README serve as proof that the model training, predictions, and interactive map components were executed successfully.*
